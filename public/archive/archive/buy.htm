To order from Falcom, you first need to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:nihon@falcom.com">nihon@falcom.com</a> similar to this:
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Dear Nihon Falcom:
<BR>
<BR>I would like to order:
<BR>
<BR>ITEMNUMBER (this is different from the catalog number, for the FMS series, it is in the format MXXX, for example M029--check Falcom's CD Page for the number)
<BR>ITEMNAME
<BR>ITEMPRICE
<BR>
<BR>(Repeat the above for each item - You can get the above info from <A HREF="http://www.falcom.co.jp/cd/index.html">Falcom's CD Page</a>)
<BR>

<BR>DATE
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Then, you need to wait for a response to it asking if the order is ok.  It might be phrased awkwardly, like this:
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>The total price is as follows.
<BR>
<BR>ITEMPRICE: ITEMNUMBER ITEMNAME
<BR>
<BR>(Repeat for every item)
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>If you are ok, we think we would like to accept your order. 
<BR>We will be looking forward to contacting from you again.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Guess what?  You send them another e-mail like this:
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>The order is OK.
<BR>
<BR>Thank you very much.
<BR>
<BR>Sincerely,
<BR>NAME
<BR>DATE
<BR>
<BR>
