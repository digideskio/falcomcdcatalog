<p><b>Site Goal: To provide English tracklists for all Falcom albums and redbook game soundtracks.</b></p>
<hr width=75%>
<p><b>Updates</b></p>
<p><b>1/8/2003</b>: Changed all of the navigational links to point directly to the album instead of the page, since some pages are quite long.  Minor fixes elsewhere as well.  Removed spreadsheet since it was fairly out of date.  Updated the how to order page with the e-mail Falcom sends when they ship the item.
<p><b>11/8/2002</b>: Added the tracklist to Zwei Super Arrange Version.  Updated the pictures for the three FMS albums which will be released on December 19th.
<p><b>11/4/2002</b>: Added a page explaining how to order CDs from Falcom (see the top of the contents pane).
<p><b>10/20/2002</b>: Updated tracklist to Music from Dinosaur.  Added the tracklists to Dinosaur Complete FM Oscillator Version and Dinosaur Ressurection Original Soundtrack.  Updated the picture to Zwei Super Arrange Version.
<p><b>10/18/2002</b>: Changed FMS6 to FMS - The Most Recent, since that is the phrase Falcom is using to describe albums released after FMS5.  Added the three additional FMS albums which will be released on December 19th (no tracklists yet).
<p><b>9/29/2002</b>: Added tracklist for FMS6.  Sincere thanks to Brandon Berg for translating the tracklists yet again.
<p><b>4/28/2002</b>: Updated this site's goal.  Updated the tracklist to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer Legend.  Deleted tracklist to  1992 Hudson CD-ROM^2 Music Complete Works, since it is not a Falcom album.
<p><b>3/20/2002</b>: Added a few previously unknown promotional albums as well as other games that have redbook audio (thanks mainly to the Falcom CD ALL List).  Changed the navigation pane so that the Falcom Millenial Series show up first.  Added a link back to the main page by clicking the picture at the top of the navigation page.  Added a link to Falcom by clicking on the main graphic (above).</p>
<p><b>3/17/2002</b>: Huge changes all over.  Cleaned up the HTML in all pages so that the code itself is easier to read and update.  All pictures are now served from the local server, so no more stealing Falcom's bandwidth.  Added tracklists to Falcom Material Collection and The Legend of Heroes Material Collection, as well as partial tracklists to most of the PC-Engine games that didn't have one. Fixed all of the broken picture links, and fixed the alt tag for all pictures so that it shows the album's name. Minor tracklist fixes elsewhere as well.</p>
<p><b>12/2/2001</b>: Added the tracklist to All Sounds of Sorcerian, and moved some more pictures over to the local server.</p>
<p><b>11/29/2001</b>: Added FMS5 page. Added link on front page to the spreadsheet version of the English Falcom discography. Moved all FMS pictures to this site. </p>
<p><b>9/20/2001</b>: Added FMS4 page. Added tracklist for Symphony Ys 21st Century. Added many new pictures.  Started the copying of all pictures to this site, so that this site does not steal Falcom's bandwith. </p>
<p><b>3/3/2001</b>: Deleted the tracklist to All Sounds of Sorcerian, because it was incorrect.</p>
<p><b>2/25/2001</b>: Added New Legend of Heroes 4 OST Disc 1 tracklist.</p>
<p><b>2/17/2001</b>: Added some tracklists to the FMS3 page, and a few minor changes elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>2/2/2001</b>: Took over the administration of the page from Kuno Christoffel.  Added JDK Band page and FMS 3 page, as well as a couple small fixes to other pages.</p>
